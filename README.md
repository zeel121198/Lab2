# Lab2
Lab 2 - Using the Express Generator

* Used the Express Generator to create lab2 website
* Used new hbs template for each member of my each family member.
* Developed a shared header that has a link with the name of my each family member.
* Each link loads a page with the name of my family member.
- Added routing to my routes/index.js file so each link loads the hbs template containing some information about the my selected member.
